About Me 

Over the past decade, I have worked as a bilingual journalist who has been an invaluable leader and effective player in corporate newsrooms, emerging media outlets, and professional organizations. With an unshakeable commitment to reaching goals and driving results, I have lived for the journey of seeing each project through from concept to completion. 

From telling heart-wrenching tales of survival of displaced tornado victims, to traveling to the Gulf of Mexico to cover clean-up efforts following an unprecedented oil spill, my career as a local television journalist for FOX, ABC, NBC, and CBS affiliates has taken me across the country, opening my eyes to the many problems of the world and the desperate pleas for solutions.

No stranger to the digital realm—in July 2015, I co-founded BNO News, a digital organization providing live coverage of breaking and developing news from around the world. The mobile and desktop site, which I designed from scratch in HTML and PHP, features original text and video content reaching more than 7 million people monthly. Our articles and videos have been syndicated worldwide by small and large media outlets such as SKY News, TIME Magazine, CBS News, and many others.

While developing BNO News, I also worked at JP Morgan Chase as a Risk Management analyst, where I analyzed fraud trends and worked alongside managers and software engineers, to create rules to flag potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. 

Prior, I launched Primo Multimedia, Inc., a small, full service production company that produced lifestyle content for Alabama and Georgia television, radio, and internet publishers.

In 2008, I served as the only hispanic, general assignment reporter covering breaking news daily in 8 counties spanning two states for WTVM-TV, the #1 rated ABC station in the Columbus, Georgia market. There, I also produced and anchored the site’s Web-only newscast, “Now Cast,” managed the web site and a small team of writers, all while hosting a weekday technology segment featuring the latest tech apps and gadgets.

I have always been fascinated by the power of the internet and technology. At 19, I launched my first blog, before blogging was even a thing. I chronicled my college life as an undergraduate student, dabbling in HTML code while learning the basics of graphic design. 

My interest in web development and graphic design helped me make enough money to get through college as a manager at OfficeMax overseeing the stores graphic and print operation, while running a small marketing and web development company on the side.

Having studied journalism extensively at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Southern Illinois University Carbondale, I eventually graduated magna cum laude from Columbia College Chicago with a B.A. in journalism in 2005.

Technology has always been apart of my life regardless of the projects or start-ups. There have been many.  And, after all these years, one thing that has always stuck around has been the desire to learn and create. Developing these sites with no formal education in development was painstaking as I spent countless hours crawling over Google search results in a desperate need to find snippets of codes or scripts to get the sites functioning. 

The challenge was difficult for a clueless developer, but enjoyable. As a creative and entrepreneurial spirit, my long hours of web work always left me craving more. With each project, I not only struggled to make my clients happy, but I became more familiar with HTML/CSS and UI design. 

Today, technology has become the game changer in not only the news business, but in all industries, as companies use it to push new products and services to make life easier. While the science isn't perfect, the power of technology is undeniable.  

I am proud of my accomplishments and thankful for the experiences my journalism career has provided, but I am ready for the next challenge.  

I guess I could continue traveling the world as an avid adventurist, or spend the day tasting new foods - but I’ve been there and done that. I’m craving something bigger. My next challenge involves developing the skills and techniques to produce software aimed at helping others solve problems.

I am deeply passionate about living, learning, and finding solutions. I look forward to using my past experiences and future education and work experiences to code for good. Whether it be an application to help those suffering from mental illnesses or developing a platform to help those struggling with health or financial issues. I cannot wait to get started.
